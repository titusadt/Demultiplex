Initial Data Exploration
ii. Read length in R1 and R4 files
    `zcat /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz | head -n 2 | grep -v '@' -A 1 | tr -d "\n" | wc`

 zcat /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz | grep '@' -A 1 | grep -v '@' | grep -v '^--'| grep 'N' -c

Part 1 code
path to distribution code:/projects/bgmp/temi/bioinfo/Bi622/Demultiplex/Assignment-the-first/distribution.py
path to submission script:/projects/bgmp/temi/bioinfo/Bi622/Demultiplex/Assignment-the-first/submit.sh
path to bioinfo:/projects/bgmp/temi/bioinfo/Bi622/Demultiplex/Assignment-the-first/bioinfo.py

Most of the script was adapted from ps4
Used argparse to get the filename, read length and name of plot
!in submission script all files are named read[1-3]_plot.png for my submission I renamed them as read 1 read 2 index 1 index 2
Used shel script to run code as an sbatch command

`sbatch ./submit.sh

Wrote a pseudo code for assignment the 3rd. more details in : /projects/bgmp/temi/bioinfo/Bi622/Demultiplex/Assignment-the-first/part2_algorithm.txt

Function log 
read_files():
    -arguments: (filename)
    -function: This function takes in the filename and reads each line in the record and returns a tuple
    -returns tuple storing each line in the file

rev_comp():
    -argument: index
    -function: this function takes the second index (sequence in R3) and returns a reverse complement

append_header():
    -arguments: read1 header, read2 header, index1, reverse_comp
    -function:this function takes the headers from r1 and r2 and append the index pairs to it and return the new header which will be written to the file

get_cutoff:
    -arguments: quality score line
    This function takes in the indexes and return True if any base is less than the cutoff and False if it is greater that the cutoff

open_files():
    -no arguments
    -this function loops through the index sets and creates output files to write to

*Stored given matched indexes in a set

Dictionaries
matched_dict{key: str(indexes), value: tuple(filehandleR1, filehandelR2)}
matched_pairs{key: str(matched index pair), value: int(frequency)}
hopped_pairs{key: str(matched hopped pair), value: int(frequency)}

Indec Sorting Condition
Unknown
-Checking if there is an N in the index
    *This was the only qulity check I did. I found that it effeciently removed the unkown indexes from the total and I was still left with enough hopped
    and matched pairs to work with. I found that when I tried to enforce a stricter quality score, it sent to many of the reads to unkown and I did not have enough
    hopped and matched reads.
    -increment unknown counter
    -write reads to file
-Check if indexes existed in matched_dict
    -increment unknown counter
    -write reads to file

Matched
-Check if index1 == reverse complement
    -increment matched counter
    -check if index pair exists in dictionary if no add 1, if yes increment by 1
    -write reads to file

Hopped
-Check if index1 != reverse complement
    -increment hopped counter
    -check if index pair exists in dictionary if no add 1, if yes increment by 1
    -write reads to file

############
ANALYSIS
############
-Create a plot for the frequency of the matched pairs
Path to plot: /projects/bgmp/temi/bioinfo/Bi622/Demultiplex/Assignment-the-third/matched_pairs.png

-Calculate the Percentage of the unknown, matched and hopped reads and write that to a file
Path to file: /projects/bgmp/temi/bioinfo/Bi622/Demultiplex/Assignment-the-third/analysis.txt

-Loop through the matched pairs dictioanry and calculate the percentage of each pair count and write to a file
Path to file: /projects/bgmp/temi/bioinfo/Bi622/Demultiplex/Assignment-the-third/matched_instances.txt

-Loop through the hopped pairs dictioanry and calculate the percentage of each pair count and write to a file
Path to file: /projects/bgmp/temi/bioinfo/Bi622/Demultiplex/Assignment-the-third/hopped_instances.txt
